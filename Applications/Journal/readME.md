## my.Journal

### Featured Code: Python - FastAPI - Postgres
This app takes in a data entry and then organizes the information in a Postgres Database.
It should utilize a simple front end web page for input such as journal entry and hasttagged metadata.
It should allow for recovery of the entries via that same front end service, allowing for recall by date or metadata tag

### Why?
I believe a journal is an important piece for organization and personal wellness. However, I hate writing by hand. With my busy schedule it can be difficult to find time to write in a notebook, and a thousand notes on my phone are difficult to read through. 
I have tried several other notetaking applications, but none that necessarily tie to my goals or fit with my intent.
By building this I'm creating a solution that can piece together (and separate) my different passions in tech, physical fitness, cooking, and family
